AI Research Assistant with RAG ðŸ§ 
Project Overview
This project demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to combat the common problem of LLM hallucination on specialized, domain-specific data. It provides a reliable and verifiable Q&A tool for technical research papers, ensuring all generated responses are grounded in the provided source documents.

The Problem
In fields with rapidly-evolving research, like AI, relying on a standard LLM to answer questions about brand-new papers can lead to several challenges:

Information Overload: Manually sifting through dense, jargon-filled papers is time-consuming.

LLM Hallucination: LLMs may generate fabricated information when they lack specific knowledge.

Lack of Verifiable Sources: Without clear source citations, it's impossible to verify the accuracy of the LLM's claims.

The Solution: A RAG System
This project builds a full-stack RAG pipeline to address these issues. The system processes a collection of research papers and creates a searchable knowledge base. When a user asks a question, the system intelligently retrieves the most relevant information from the papers and uses it to augment a Gemini model's response. The final output includes a concise answer and the exact source snippets used to generate it.

Key Features
Robust Data Ingestion: Reads and processes multiple PDF research papers.

Advanced Text Cleaning: A cleaning pipeline removes artifacts from PDF extraction, ensuring data integrity.

Efficient Vectorization: Converts text into high-quality embeddings using a powerful embedding model.

Lightning-Fast Search: Utilizes a FAISS index for rapid semantic search to find the most relevant document chunks.

Intelligent Generation: Employs the Gemini model to synthesize accurate, concise, and context-aware answers.
